## Questions

- Why is it important to choose a LICENSE?
    - If you want your project to be open source, you should make that very
    clear or else other people will be unwilling to derive off of your project
    in fear that there exists a copyright. This kind of defeats the purpose of
    having an open source project in the first place, so putting it on there is
    important for reaping the benefits of open source. On the flip side, non
    open source projects need to make that clear as to not confuse viewers.
- Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
    - Default copyright rules apply when a project doesn't have a LICENSE. Many
    people assume that whatever is on Github is free to use, but that isn't
    necessarily the case. So, you won't know the author's true intention with
    the code, and you could end up in legal trouble without the existence of a
    license that explicitly says that you may use the project in whatever way
    you wish.
- Do you agree with the claims in "Why the Web beat Gopher"?
    - I disagree with the notion that the Gopher team failed due to not
    releasing their software to the public. The article claims that this would
    have allowed the larger development community to make edits and improve the
    code, as it was better to let them decide what "the right thing" was rather
    than decide it themselves. People don't always know what they want, and the
    popular choice isn't always the best. Apple is particularly notorious for
    making brash decisions that tend to cause a divide amongst the community,
    but more often than not their decisions end up becoming standard, such as
    the choice to increase the size of the iPhone. Many consumers pushed back on
    that, but most people will agree retroactively that it was a good decision,
    despite not being super popular at the time.
- Can you justify why GPL v2 for Linux is chosen based on the history, goals and
    philosophy of Linux?
    - GPL v2 ensures that software under it is free for all users in the sense
    that anyone can share or modify it. This fits Linux, which was written with
    the goal of creating a popular, free kernel. There already existed kernels
    that were free in terms of price, but not free in the sense that they could
    be shared or modified, and that pushed Linus Torvalds to develop Linux so
    that there could be a widely adopted, truly free kernel.
